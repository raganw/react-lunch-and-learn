# System check

### Requirements

node (install via `brew` or your package manager of choice)


### Instructions

```
git clone git@github.com:raganw/react-lunch-and-learn.git
cd react-lunch-and-learn
npm run check
```


### What just happened?

If everything succeeded, all npm dependencies were installed, a lint check was run,
two tests were run, a source bundle was built, a development server was started,
and a webpage popped up with a message.

You can `^C` out of the development server.
